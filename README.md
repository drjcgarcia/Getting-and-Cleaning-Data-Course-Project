Repository for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Week #4 Project

The script run_analysis.R retrieves the Human Activity Recognition Dataset (Anguita, et.al., 2012) and performs the following manipulations:

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Renames the activities in the data set with descriptive terms.
  4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  6. Writes tidy data set to output file: Garcia_Tidy_Data.txt
